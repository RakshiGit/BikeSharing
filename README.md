# Project Name
> Bike Sharing

I have submitted two files. Each one contains one analysis. 
BikeSharing_Manual.ipynb has analysis done by manually eliminating the variables and arriving at a good R2.
BikeSharing_RFE.ipynb has analysis done by eliminating variables using RFE method. 


## Table of Contents
* [General Info]
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.


* [Technologies Used]
Python, Jupyter

## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 


In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

Data for analysis has been provided in day.csv

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Temp, yr and season_spring are highly correlated to COUNT and the combo led to R2 of 73%
- Count is more during summers and fall season and even month graph suggests the same.
- Registered users are using the rides more than casual users
- Error terms are normally distributed.
